A few weeks ago, I decided to attempt to make my very own MUD (Multi User Dungeon) which is a small text based game which can be played by multiple people simultaneously. I've never played a MUD before, but it seemed like a fun project. I decided to use Go because I wanted concurrency and just to use a new language for fun.
